# Outcome Adaptive LASSO
This repository contains a Python implementation of the paper [Outcome-Adaptive Lasso: Variable Selection for Causal Inference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5591052/pdf/nihms-852754.pdf) (*Shortreed and Ertefaie, 2017*)

The code is also posted on [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/outcome-adaptive-lasso-variable-selection-for)

This is a preliminary implementation, it has not been reviewed and it may contain inaccuracies. If you find anything that needs fixing, please let me know/file an issue/PR

run_example.ipynb is a simple example for generating the data like used in the paper, and then running the Outcome Adaptive LASSO on it.

generate_boxplots.py is a script to reproduce some of the figures in the paper, comparing the OAL to plain IPW based estimation
