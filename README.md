# Outcome Adaptive LASSO
Python implementation of the paper 'Outcome-Adaptive Lasso: Variable Selection for Causal Inference' of Shortreed and Ertefaie, 2017

This is a preliminary implementation, it has not been reviewed and it may contain inaccuracies. If you find anything that needs fixing, please let me know/file an issue/PR

run_example.ipynb is a simple example for generating the data like used in the paper, and then running the Outcome Adaptive LASSO on it.

generate_boxplots.py is a script to reproduce some of the figures in the paper, comparing the OAL to plain IPW based estimation
